## For open projects

For open documentation or DevChallenge projects, your contribution must be made in their repositories. Following the same review and approval rule made by the DevChallenge team.

## Non-code or Low-code Contributions

"Contributing to open source is not just for technical people who want to write code. There are many opportunities to use your professional skills in support of open source projects. At this year's Hacktoberfest, we are keen to encourage contributions that require some technical experience or none at all. .no matter your experience, you can participate in the hacktoberfest!

**Low code:** Technical Documentation, Tests, Case Studies, Technical Posts

**Non Code:** Translations of documentations from other languages, UI's, like a Figma layout of pages

## Deliverables Non code and Low code

- Implement a S.O.L.I.D principle, and detail in a brief explanation, the code snippet to which it is applied.

- Document one of the 22 existing design patterns, and show a code example of the problem that it solves in your preferred programming language/framework.

- Show two of the existing Code smells, and apply in a code example, how it can be solved in a practical way.
  
- Create layouts for product pages, blog pots, forms, login, minicart etc, we ask that if you choose to go with a UI deliverable layout, create a simple styleguide for it.

For the cases mentioned above, it does not necessarily have to be a functional application, but the concept that is applied, if you want you can make comments on the lines of the code snippet.

**Important**: As a rule, only one of each topic per contributor can be delivered, that is, you cannot make the same topic more than once

### How to deliver

- Ps: you must send your solution inside the folder [low-code](./low-code) or [non-code](./non-code/). Remember to put it in a folder titled ``[subject topic]-[your username]``.
Ex: <b>code-smell-Lucas0019</b>
